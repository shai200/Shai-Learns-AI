Welcome back to your daily FAANG prep party from Shai-Learns-AI! 🎉
 Today’s question comes straight from Google and originally appeared in an awesome email series called The Daily Byte — made by a Staff Engineer at Instagram (so yeah, it's legit).
Here’s the challenge:
 👉 Reverse all the characters in a string and return the result.
 Sounds easy, right? Like... how hard can it be to flip some letters?
Let’s see a few examples:
Example 1: "Cat" → "taC" (meow turned wow)
 Example 2: "The Daily Byte" → "etyB yliaD ehT"
 Example 3: "civic" → "civic" (a palindrome flex 😎)
It might look simple, but don’t let this one fool you — this is where clean thinking and quick coding shine.
🧠 Before we dive into the code, fire up your favorite IDE —
 Maybe it’s VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, or even Jupyter Notebook if you're feeling scientific.
🚨 Pause the video now.
 Try solving it on your own — seriously, give it a shot.
 Then hit play again and let’s compare notes. Like... did we both forget semicolons or nah?
✋ Go ahead. I’ll wait. (cue dramatic Jeopardy music 🎵)

Alright, let’s break it down — in FOUR languages.

Python (a.k.a. the cool kid who writes poetry):
def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:
    return s[::-1]

Slicing like a ninja! One-liner magic — Python really said: “Hold my whitespace.”

Java (because some of us like our code verbose and caffeinated):
public class ReverseString {
    public static String reverse(String s) {
        return new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();
    }
}

Java's like, "Why say it in 1 line when you can say it in 3?"
 Still... gotta love that trusty StringBuilder.

TypeScript (aka JavaScript with a type safety glow-up):
function reverseString(s: string): string {
    return s.split('').reverse().join('');
}

Split it. Flip it. Stick it back together.
 Basically the sandwich method of reversing strings 🥪

C++ (for when you like full control and STL wizardry):
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string reverseString(string s) {
    reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
    return s;
}

C++ be like: “I got this.”
 Just call reverse() from the standard library and call it a day. Efficient and elegant, just like your grandma's cooking 🥘

And that’s a wrap!
 Four languages. One problem. Endless ways to flex. 💪
